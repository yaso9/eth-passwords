# ETH Passwords
ETH Passwords is a password manager built on the Ethereum blockchain. All sensitive information is encrypted with AES encryption to keep it secure.

## Why?
I wanted to learn about Ethereum smart contracts and dapps. This project was a good introduction to both.

## Limitations
While the ETH Passwords app itself is very usable, gas charges for adding data to the blockchain are pretty high. This makes using it a bit expensive. Reading from the blockchain, however, is free.
